# Proof Material

## Overview

Use this skill as the intermediate proof library between `proof-finder` and `proof-cooker`. It preserves one source's proof topology per file so later agents can trace every reusable idea back to a public source, a paper location, and a stable material ID.

`proof-material` is not the final proof playbook. Do not organize it by final technique or strategy category; organize it by original source.

## Pipeline Position

`proof-material` sits after extraction and before synthesis:

```text
proof-finder -> proof-material -> proof-cooker
```

Its job is fidelity. Keep source-local structure, stable IDs, paper locations, dependencies, tags, and reusable abstractions intact so `proof-cooker` can later make taxonomy decisions without losing evidence.

## Library Layout

- Keep the global source index at [references/index.md](references/index.md).
- Create one material file per public source under `references/<source-slug>.md`.
- Use lowercase hyphenated source slugs, usually `<authors-year-short-title>.md`.
- Keep scratch prompts, DeepSeek transcripts, and one-off run logs outside tracked files.

## Source File Contract

Each source material file should use this structure:

```markdown
# <Paper Title>

## Source Metadata

- Source kind: `PDF`
- Public title:
- Authors:
- Year:
- Source file name:
- Public citation:

## Local Index

| ID | Paper location | Type | Short name | Tags | Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Items

### <ID>: <Short name>

- Type: `DETAIL`
- Paper location:
- Depends on:
- Local statement:
- Reusable abstraction:
- Proof skeleton:
- Why it is valuable:
- Backtest signal:
- Candidate tags:
- Cooker hints:
```

Use `DETAIL`, `STRATEGY`, `DEFINITION`, `DEPENDENCY`, or `BOTH` as extraction labels only. These are not final proof-usage categories.

## Update Workflow

1. Identify the source and slug.
   - Reuse an existing material file when the public source already appears in the index.
   - Create a new file only when the source is genuinely new.
2. Preserve source topology.
   - Record section, theorem, lemma, equation, page, algorithm line, proof paragraph, or appendix location when available.
   - Keep definitions and dependencies near the items that rely on them.
3. Assign stable IDs.
   - Use a short source prefix plus a two-digit counter, such as `CR24-D01` or `GGSXY25-S02`.
   - Never renumber an existing ID because an item is moved, merged, or cooked later.
4. Rewrite for reuse.
   - Separate `Local statement` from `Reusable abstraction`.
   - Keep `Proof skeleton` concise; do not paste long source passages.
   - Mark uncertainty honestly in `Cooker hints` rather than overstating a theorem.
5. Update [references/index.md](references/index.md).
   - Add or adjust item counts, main domains, and tags.
   - Keep the index lightweight enough for quick routing.

## Public Safety

- Do not include private machine paths, account names, unpublished project details, raw transcripts, or local operational logs.
- Use public citations, public titles, and source filenames only when they do not reveal private workspace details.
- Prefer generic examples such as `sample-project` or `private-workspace` when explaining local scratch areas.
- Attribute ideas to public sources, but keep source excerpts short and paraphrased.

## Handoff To Proof Cooker

When enough material exists for synthesis, pass one or more material files to `proof-cooker`. The cooker may cluster, merge, or split items, but it must preserve backward links to these stable material IDs.
